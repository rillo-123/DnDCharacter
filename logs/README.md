# Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by:
- `backend.py` - Flask server logs
- `activate-env.py` - Python setup script logs
- `activate-env.ps1` - PowerShell setup script logs
- `activate-env.sh` - Bash setup script logs

## Log Files

- `flask_server.log` - Flask server output (with rotation)
- `activate-env.log` - Setup script output (combined from all scripts)

## Log Rotation

Flask server logs are automatically rotated when they exceed 10MB. Up to 5 backup files are kept.

## Debugging

Check these logs when:
- Flask server won't start
- Dependencies aren't installing
- Export functionality fails
- You need to troubleshoot issues

## Example: Reading logs

```bash
# View Flask server logs
tail -f logs/flask_server.log

# View setup script logs  
tail -f logs/activate-env.log

# Search for errors
grep ERROR logs/*.log
```

## Git

Logs are excluded from version control (see .gitignore). Each developer keeps their own logs locally.
